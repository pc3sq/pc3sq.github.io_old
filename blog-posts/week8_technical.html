			<h2>Test Driven Development</h2>

				<h3>In A Nutshell</h3>
				<p>
					Test driven development - or TDD - proposes to start the development process with <i>tests</i> that defines an improvement or new function to a program. While there are different flavors of TDD, most styles seek ask that the developer write the least amount of code to make the test pass first. Refactoring for readability and scalability is a later (but important) consideration.

				<h3>What About BDD?</h3>
				<p>
					Many developers will tell you that BDD is TDD but done right. What they mean is that BDD is TDD but with particular focus on what a user wants and expects out of a system rather than simply testing system outputs. This is very nuanced. You can tell BDD is being used if the tests are phrased more semantically and if you see more integration tests, tests written to test a few functions/features together, being used.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a product manager (PM), I cared more about what a user saw and expected from a system so I favored BDD in my work. In fact, if you have technical PM, having the PM write BDD can save you time and miscommunications that result from improperly translated user stories.

				<p>
					So remember, there is no distinction between BDD or TDD, it's just a matter of keeping best practices in mind while doing test driven development.
