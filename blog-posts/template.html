		<h2>Consider The Design</h2>
		<h3>Buzzfeed</h3>
		<p>Buzzfeed is a very colorful, clean, vibrant, modern, and stylized website that packages various content into bite-sized portions. The content can be practical, humorous, downright silly, random, and even serious.</p>

		<p>When you first look at Buzzfeed's homepage, their logo and bright yellow categories stand out. As you step back,you notice the heading of most popular article as well.</p>

		<p>The site is quite easy to navigate. You know where you are at all times and you can easily jump to your favorite categories with the aid of the category links up top.</p>

		<p>I limit my time on Buzzfeed mostly to the highlights. I don't find spending hours on it to be a good use of my time. If I did spend copious amounts of time on it, it wouldn't be enjoyable because I like to balance my day with productive activities.</p>

		<h3>Quora</h3>



		<h3>Reddit</h3>
		<p>Reddit is a simple, barebones, utiliarian yet busy and outdated forum style website for content sorted into specific topic sub-forums known as "subreddits". The content spans the imaginable gamut from the obscene to the refined, the grotesque to the cutest, the bizarre to the boring. Reddit is as educational as it is shocking and entertaining. You name it and there is probably a subreddit for the topic you are searching. If a subreddit doesn't exist, making one is as easy and free as registering for the site.</p>

		<p>Reddit is not the easiest to navigate, particularly because many of the links are not intuitively named. But once you are familiar with the lingo of a typical "redditor", you will soon know there isn't much to the stie to make it entertain.</p>

		<p>To avoid spending too much time on Reddit, you can simply check out the "Hot" or "Rising" lists which are some default lists you can click on that are available to you on the homepage. Similarly, you can follow certain subreddits so you know you can narrow the firehose that is Reddit content. It's motto when it first started was "The Front Page of the Internet". I don't think it quite lived up to its name for the internet public in general but many of my friends certainly go to it as often as say Google.com.</p>
