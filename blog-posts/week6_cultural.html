			<h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
			<article>
				<h3>What is Stereotype Threat?</h3>
				<p>
					Stereotype threat is the threat being seen as a negative stereotype or the threat of confirming or fulfilling the stereotype. When you perceive stereotype threat, your cognition is impaired by the constant vigilance you feel necessary to guard against the threat. You are intimidated by the stereotypes against you. Furthermore, you can be in a protracted state of mistrust and anxiety. These impairments may be one reason why negatively stereotyped students receive lower marks than their stereotypically positive or neutral peers.

				<h3>When Does Stereotype Threat Arise?</h3>
				<p>
					Stereotype threat arises when what is salient to you appears to apply in the context. For example, in a <a href="http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-events/the-stereotype-threat-dr-claude-steele-mesmerizes-audience-video/">study conducted by Claude M. Steele</a>, blacks students performed significantly worse than their white counterparts on a exam made up of questions from a verbal section of the GREs <b>when the exam was presented as a cognitive test</b>. When the same exam was presented as a puzzle, the black students performed virtually at the same level as the white students.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the exam was presented as a cognitive test, the black students became aware of the stereotypes that blacks don't perform well on these types of exams. As a result, the saliency of these stereotypes allocated their cognitive resources to defending against the negative stereotypes leaving them with lesser ability and concentration for the exam itself. The students who saw the exam as game never saw their negative stereotypes come into play and so they did not feel stereotype threats that would impair their ability to perform on the exam.

				<h3>What Can We Do About Stereotype Threat?</h3>
				<p>
					Having strong emotionaly intelligence (EQ) is one key way to heighten your ability to detect and combat stereotype threat. To have strong EQ, you must practice awareness of yourself and others. One way to practice awareness is to find analogous experiences in your own life that may apply to someone who is experiencing stereotype threat.
				</p>
					Another way to practice awareness is to practice communicating with others about how you are feeling. Often times when you share your thoughts, feelings, and stories, you'll find that all of us experiencing the same things despite how differently we identify ourselves. In other words, sharing our thoughts, feelings, and stories can dispel the belief that negative experiences are due to some fulfilment of a negative stereotype and instead may just be because of improper instructions, unjust laws, having an off day, etc.
