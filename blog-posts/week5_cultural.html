			<h2>Pairing &amp; Feedback</h2>
			<article>
				<h3>Feelings That Arise</h3>
				<p>
					Most of my pairings have been positive experiences. I can't recall any instance where I was frustrated for more than a few seconds because all my partners so far have been very understanding and knowledgeable.

				<h3>Providing 'ASK' Feedback Is Harder Than You Think</h3>
				<p>
					The problem with most feedback is that they are not actionable, specific, or kind enough. The reason why ASK feedback is hard to provide is because many of us aren't used to providing feedback with such specificty and action-orientation. Providing ASK style feedback is a trainable skill and at this point, I can say I am more familiar with how an ASK style feedback should be structured.

				<h3>What I Can Improve On</h3>
				<p>
					Based on my more recent feedback, I would say I need to be more patient. Howevever, I wasn't given enough actionable items to improve my patience. So, my best guess on becoming more patient is to give more time and space for my partner to think.

				<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
				<p>Overall, I think pairing and feedback is important but they can only be valuable and effective if we provide proper training and adequate time to participate in them. I hope to get further training and time to participate heading into Phase 1.
