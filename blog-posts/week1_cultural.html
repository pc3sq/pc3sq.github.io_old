		<h2>Chefs In The Kitchen</h2>
		<h3>Kitchen vs. Table Approach Towards Learing</h3>
		

		<p>Shereef's fireside chat solidified my understanding of DBC's philosophy and approach towards teaching. At first, I had mixed expectiations because I am naturally skeptical of things that show a lot of promise (i.e. 85% to 90% employment shortly after DBC).</p>

		<p>Do not think that I am skeptical because I understood that DBC would require a lot of commitment from my part. My skepticism afraid from fear, specifically that I haven't experienced DBC for myself and so I cannot know how DBC will work for me. To put it another way, I was afraid that DBC will disappoint me.</p>

		<p>Watching Shereef answer some difficult questions allayed some of my fears about DBC. He clarified on some of the statistics about dropouts and employment. And by using the kitchen vs. table analogy, that seeing DBC as a package deal and feeling like an entitled consumer vs. knowing making the meal yourself with others helps you appreciate what you accomplish and establishes your accountancy and stakes in your outcome.</p>

		<p>Shereef also addressed the common "imposter's syndrome" as well as the "tyranny of the average" experienced by many of us enterring into DBC. Honestly, I feel more of the former than the latter and I will work harder to be more confident in what I know and what I don't know so that others know that I am competent and that I curious to learn more.</p>

		<p>I have guarded optimism in entering DBC. On the one hand, I come from a academic and philosophical background that encourages sharing and being honest about what you know. On the other hand, I've seen many people fail because they simply either are not ready to share themselves and what they know so you are met with resistance. My hope is that DBC does in fact do a good job with filtering out those who will at least give this culture a shot.</p>
