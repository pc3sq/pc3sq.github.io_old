				<h2>Consider The Design</h2>
				<h3>Buzzfeed</h3>
				<p>Buzzfeed is a very colorful, clean, vibrant, modern, and stylized website that packages various content into bite-sized portions. The content can be practical, humorous, downright silly, random, and even serious.</p>

				<p>When you first look at Buzzfeed's homepage, their logo and bright yellow categories stand out. As you step back,you notice the heading of most popular article as well.</p>

				<p>The site is quite easy to navigate. You know where you are at all times and you can easily jump to your favorite categories with the aid of the category links up top.</p>

				<p>I limit my time on Buzzfeed mostly to the highlights. I don't find spending hours on it to be a good use of my time. If I did spend copious amounts of time on it, it wouldn't be enjoyable because I like to balance my day with productive activities.</p>

				<h3>Quora</h3>

				<p>Quora is a easy to use, straightforward, minimalist, intuitive, and optimized q&amp;a website that was once popular with the startup crowd but since become more accessible to general web surfers. You can look up specific questions like "What is the biggest surprise about getting rich?" or "Where did the Deep south get her not-so-positive image from?". If your question doesn't appear in a Quora search, you can ask one someone. You can upvote or downvote given answers, see what are the most popular answers to a question, and you can even follow a question that interests you.</p>

				<p>Quora keeps things simple and does a good job to help you not encumber your experience of their site. In other words, they do enough to make the experience seamless and mostly get out of your way. When you first look at the site, you'll notice the search bar. This makes sense because you are mainly on Quora to search for answers to questions. When you step back, you'll notice the tri-column design more, each with a list. From left to right they are "Top Stories", questions based on topics you follow under your profile, and suggested topics you can follow to "Improve Your Feed".</p>

				<p>Depending on the author of the question or answers, you will find content that is serious, funny, practical, beautifully written, and opinionated. Most people are respectful even when they disagree, unlike some sites like Yahoo Answers or Yelp.</p>

				<p>For me, Quora, like StackOverflow, is mainly a site you consult rather than meander through.</p>


				<h3>Reddit</h3>
				<p>Reddit is a simple, barebones, utiliarian yet busy and outdated forum style website for content sorted into specific topic sub-forums known as "subreddits". The content spans the imaginable gamut from the obscene to the refined, the grotesque to the cutest, the bizarre to the boring. Reddit is as educational as it is shocking and entertaining. You name it and there is probably a subreddit for the topic you are searching. If a subreddit doesn't exist, making one is as easy and free as registering for the site.</p>

				<p>When you first get to the homepage, you will notice different lists of posts categorized by the how they are "trending" like the hot list, the new list, rising, controversial, etc. These trending categories, however, are not the same as the subrreddits (I think).</p>

				<p>To avoid spending too much time on Reddit, you can simply check out the "Hot" or "Rising" lists which are some default lists you can click on that are available to you on the homepage. Similarly, you can follow certain subreddits so you cam narrow the firehose that is Reddit content. It's motto when it first started was "The Front Page of the Internet". I don't think it quite lived up to its name for the internet public in general but many of my friends certainly go to it as often as say Google.com.</p>

				<p>Reddit is not the easiest to navigate, particularly because many of the links are not intuitively named. But once you are familiar with the lingo of a typical "redditor", you will soon know there isn't much to the stie to make it entertain.</p>
