			<h2>Dealing With Conflict: Shame</h2>
			<article>
				<p>
					Growing up, I didn't know how to respond when others asked about my family. These inquirers seemed to know so much about everyone in their family, from their parents to their aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents. I, on the other hand, didn't even know when my mom's birthday was or where my dad grew up. "Was this weird?" I asked myself. "My parents and I don't celebrate our birthdays. Why is this stuff so important to everyone? And is it important to be in touch with my cousins? I've heard they existed but I've never met them before."  I felt ashamed for having knowing so little about my own family. The often uninhibited judgment from my young classmates would exacerbate my shame.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reflecting with my parents helped me gain more insight and perspective in later years. It was simple really. Providing for the family was most important so things like birthdays had to take a backseat at the time. Many children of immigrants can relate to these practical realities. In fact, I had adopted similar practical approaches in my life. Work to build a basis of comfort first. Extracirriculars and self-actualization came later, if we had the luxury. Without realizing it, my parents were following Maslow's heirarchy. 
				</p>
				<p>
					So then why did I feel shame? It should come as no surprise that wanting to belong was at the forefront my young self's mind. But without the wisdom of knowing that all families are different, I put myself down for not being <i>normal</i>. I don't think that I had the capacity at that young age to cope with the shame any other way. Thankfully, I had my parents to reflect with and debrief my childhood.
				</p>
				<p>
					I read that it is important to show kindness towards your feelings of shame. I am practical so I would advise something more fundamental. Work on feeling and being loved and accepted. The desire to belong doesn't go away as an adult but we are wiser to the fact that we can be different and still belong. Remember that and surround yourself with people who understand that.
